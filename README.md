# CS50-Final-Project

The goal of this project is to take the publicly available database of Lichess puzzles (https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles) and filter it so you can work on particular endgame puzzles. For example: if you wanted to work on rook and pawn endgames, the app will return only puzzles containing rooks and pawns.
